  I am a junior studying finance and marketing at Emory University in Atlanta, GA. I am seeking at internship for Summer 2023. 
  
  Currently, I maintain a rigorous 20 credit hour courseload, have a marketing research internship with Theater Emory, work part-time as a barista, and hold a TA position for Business Communications. In my extracurricular involvement, I'm the vice president of Emory Red Light, an antihuman trafficking organization, and vice president of mentorship of Emory Transfer Student Organization. My busy schedule has given me experience in task prioritization and time management, skills that I will take into any role that I step into. I am quick learner and hope to gain more hands-on experience and knowledge during my internship this summer. My skills include <mark>Excel</mark> and <mark>Python</mark>, and I have basic experience with Java and R Studio and am learning Nim.

  You can even add paragraphs by using empty lines like this and add anything else [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started#what-is-markdown) supports such as
    - Lists

          As a TA, my primary job is to lead a team of six new BBAs through two case competitions, teaching them vital communication skills. I coach students on their public speaking skills and on the effectiveness of their presentations, drawing on my years of experience as a private debate tutor. I also uttilize conflict management to resolve group tensions or personal issues of individual students. In addition to the active role I play with students, I also track class progress, grade assignments, and coordinate with a team of 12 TAs to create a seamless learning experience for the students.

          The first project I am assigned to in this role is the promotion of an outside client's production, Mlima's Tale. In this project, I will draft licensing papers to acquire and reimagine existing student projects for the purpose of promoting Mlima's Tale. I will have creative freedom of how Mlima's Tale will be marketed to Seven Stages' existing audience. 
          My second project for this role will take focus on buildling an audience rather than promoting to it. In this role, I will work with Theater Emory's company manager to research and analyze data to identify a target audience and market towards them. This will involve hands-on experience in community engagement with the purpose of creating a long-term audience.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
